# findmypast-primes

Contained in this repo is my solution for the "prime tables" coding challenge! I hope you enjoy playing with it üòÑ

## How to run it

From the terminal, clone this repository by using the command: 

`git clone https://github.com/jakewmiles/findmypast-primes.git`

Still in the terminal, enter `cd findprimes` and then `npm install` to install the required dependencies inside of the app.

Still inside of the terminal, run `npm t` to run the Mocha testing suite.

Lastly, you can run `npm start` to spin up the React App in your browser. It should open up automagically üôÇ 

Enjoy sliding to create larger/smaller multiplication tables!

Once you're done, you can close down the React App from the terminal by hitting `Ctrl + C` on your keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è

## What I'm pleased with

I'm pleased with how interactive I've managed to make the algorithm in such a short space of time. Building with React is a lot of fun!

## What I would do with more time

I would definitely pay a little more attention to the styling of the app, although you can scroll to the right and down to see further prime multiplication tables, some more complex CSS could potentially allow for the multiplcation factors to remain permanently visible, for example.
