# findmypast-primes

Contained in this repo is my solution for the "prime tables" coding challenge! I hope you enjoy playing with it :)

# How to run it

Clone this repository by using the command `git clone https://github.com/jakewmiles/findmypast-primes.git` inside of your terminal.

Enter the repository with the command `cd findprimes` and then run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

You can run `npm t` to run the Mocha testing suite.

You can then run `npm start` after to spin up the React App in your browser. Enjoy sliding to create larger/smaller multiplication tables!

# What I'm pleased with

I'm pleased with how interactive I've managed to make the algorithm in such a short space of time. Building with React is a lot of fun!

# What I would do with more time

I would definitely pay a little more attention to the styling of the app, although you can scroll to the right and down to see further prime multiplication tables, some more complex CSS could potentially allow for the multiplcation factors to remain permanently visible, for example.
